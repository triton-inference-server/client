# GenAI-Perf

A tool to facilitate benchmarking generative AI models leveraging NVIDIA’s
[performance analyzer tool](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer).

GenAI-Perf builds upon the performant stimulus generation of the performance
analyzer to easily benchmark LLMs. Multiple endpoints are currently supported.

The GenAI-Perf workflow enables a user to
* [Generate prompts](#model-inputs) using either
  * synthetic generated data
  * open orca or CNN daily mail datasets
* Transform the prompts to a format understood by the
[chosen endpoint](#basic-usage)
  * Triton Infer
  * OpenAI
* Use Performance Analyzer to drive stimulus
* Gather LLM relevant [metrics](#metrics)
* Generate reports

all from the [command line](#cli).

> [!Note]
> GenAI-Perf is currently in early release while under rapid development.
> While we will try to remain consistent, command line options are subject to
> change until the software hits 1.0. Known issues will also be documented as the
> tool matures.

# Installation

## Triton SDK Container

Available starting with the 24.03 release of the
[Triton Server SDK container](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tritonserver).

```bash
RELEASE="24.03"

docker run -it --net=host --gpus=all  nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

genai-perf --help
```

## From Source

This method requires that Perf Analyzer is installed in your development
environment.

```bash
RELEASE="24.03"

pip install "git+https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client.git@r${RELEASE}#egg=genai-perf&subdirectory=src/c++/perf_analyzer/genai-perf"

genai-perf --help
```

# Basic Usage

## Triton with TRT-LLM

```bash
genai-perf -m llama-2-7b --concurrency 1 --service-kind triton --backend trtllm
```

## Triton with vLLM

```bash
genai-perf -m llama-2-7b --concurrency 1 --service-kind triton --backend vllm
```

## OpenAI Chat Completions Compatible APIs

https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat

```bash
genai-perf -m llama-2-7b --concurrency 1 --service-kind openai --endpoint v1/chat/completions
```

## OpenAI Completions Compatible APIs

https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions

```bash
genai-perf -m llama-2-7b --concurrency 1 --service-kind openai --endpoint v1/completions
```

> [!Note]
> GenAI-Perf uses Llama tokenizer as a default tokenizer to parse and calculate
> token metrics on the input prompts and output responses. Users can instead
> specify a custom huggingface tokenizer using `--tokenizer` command line option
> as well.


# Model Inputs
GenAI-Perf supports model input prompts from either synthetically generated inputs,
or from the HuggingFace OpenOrca or CNN_DailyMail datasets. This is specified
using the `--prompt-source` CLI option.

When the dataset is synthetic, you can specify the following options:
* `--num-prompts`: The number of unique prompts to generate.
* `--synthetic-input-tokens-mean`: The mean number of tokens of synthetic input data.
* `--synthetic-input-tokens-stddev`: The standard deviation of the number of tokens of synthetic
  input data.
* `--random-seed`: The seed used to generate random values.

When the dataset is coming from HuggingFace, you can specify the following
options:
* `--num-prompts`: The number of unique prompts to generate.
* `--dataset`: HuggingFace dataset to use for benchmarking.

For any dataset, you can specify the following options:
* `--output-tokens-mean`: The mean number of tokens to request from the model.
* `--output-tokens-mean-deterministic`: If an output token mean is supplied,
this will make the token count distribution set the max and min lengths equal.
This is supported for the Triton service-kind.
* `--output-tokens-stddev`: The standard deviation of the number of tokens to
request from the model. input data.

You can optionally set additional model inputs with the following option:
* `--extra-inputs {input_name}:{value}`: An additional input for use with the model with a singular value,
such as `stream:true` or `max_tokens:5`. This flag can be repeated to supply multiple extra inputs.


# Metrics

GenAI-Perf collects a diverse set of metrics that captures the performance of
the inference server.

| Metric | Description | Aggregations |
| - | - | - |
| Time to First Token | Time between when a request is sent and when its first response is received, one value per request in benchmark | Avg, min, max, p99, p90, p75 |
| Inter Token Latency | Time between intermediate responses for a single request divided by the number of generated tokens of the latter response, one value per response per request in benchmark | Avg, min, max, p99, p90, p75 |
| Request Latency | Time between when a request is sent and when its final response is received, one value per request in benchmark | Avg, min, max, p99, p90, p75 |
| Number of Output Tokens | Total number of output tokens of a request, one value per request in benchmark | Avg, min, max, p99, p90, p75 |
| Output Token Throughput | Total number of output tokens from benchmark divided by benchmark duration | None–one value per benchmark |
| Request Throughput | Number of final responses from benchmark divided by the benchmark duration | None–one value per benchmark |

# CLI

##### `-h`
##### `--help`

##### `-v`
##### `--verbose`

Enables verbose mode.

##### `--version`

Prints the version and exits.

##### `--output-tokens-mean <int>`

The mean of the number of output tokens to request from the model.

##### `--output-tokens-mean-deterministic`

Sets the output token distribution to add a minimum token length input
(in addition to the maximum token length) to more deterministically
request the number of output tokens from the model.

##### `--output-tokens-stddev <int>`

The standard deviation of the number of output tokens to request from the model.

##### `-m <str>`

the requests completed within that time interval.

The default value is `10000`.

##### `--profile-export-file <file>`

Specifies the path where the perf_analyzer profile export will be generated. By
default, the profile export will be to profile_export.json. The genai-perf file

such as `stream:true` or `max_tokens:5`. This flag can be repeated to supply multiple extra inputs.

# Known Issues

* GenAI-Perf can be slow to finish if a high request-rate is provided
* Token counts may not be exact
* Token output counts are much higher than reality for now when running on
triton server, because the input is reflected back into the output
