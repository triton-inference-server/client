# Profiling Multiple LoRA Adapters
GenAI-Perf allows you to profile multiple LoRA adapters on top of a base model.

## Selecting LoRA Adapters
To do this, list multiple adapters after the model name option `-m`:

```bash
genai-perf -m lora_adapter1 lora_adapter2 lora_adapter3
```

## Choosing a Strategy for Selecting Models
When profiling with multiple models, you can specify how the models should be
assigned to prompts using the `--model-selection-strategy` option:

```bash
genai-perf \
    -m lora_adapter1 lora_adapter2 lora_adapter3 \
    --model-selection-strategy round_robin
```

This setup will cycle through the lora_adapter1, lora_adapter2, and
lora_adapter3 models in a round-robin manner for each prompt.

For more details on additional options and configurations, refer to the
[Command Line Options section](../README.md#command-line-options) in the README.
