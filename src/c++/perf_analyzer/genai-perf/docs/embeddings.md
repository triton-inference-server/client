# Profile Embeddings Models with GenAI-Perf

GenAI-Perf allows you to profile embedding models running on an
[OpenAI Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)-compatible server.

## Create a Sample Embeddings Input File

To create a sample embeddings input file, use the following command:

```bash
echo '{"text": "What was the first car ever driven?"}
{"text": "Who served as the 5th President of the United States of America?"}
{"text": "Is the Sydney Opera House located in Australia?"}
{"text": "In what state did they film Shrek 2?"}' > embeddings.jsonl
```

This will generate a file named embeddings.jsonl with the following content:
```jsonl
{"text": "What was the first car ever driven?"}
{"text": "Who served as the 5th President of the United States of America?"}
{"text": "Is the Sydney Opera House located in Australia?"}
{"text": "In what state did they film Shrek 2?"}
```

## Start an OpenAI Embeddings-Compatible Server
To start an OpenAI embeddings-compatible server, run the following command:
```bash
docker run -it --net=host --rm --gpus=all vllm/vllm-openai:latest --model intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct --dtype float16 --max-model-len 1024
```

## Run GenAI-Perf
To profile embeddings models using GenAI-Perf, use the following command:

```bash
genai-perf \
    -m intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct \
    --service-kind openai \
    --endpoint-type embeddings \
    --batch-size 2 \
    --input-file embeddings.jsonl
```

This will use default values for optional arguments. You can also pass in
additional arguments with the `--extra-inputs` [flag](../README.md#input-options).
For example, you could use this command:

```bash
genai-perf \
    -m intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct \
    --service-kind openai \
    --endpoint-type embeddings \
    --extra-inputs user:sample_user
```

Example output:
