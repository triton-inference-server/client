# Benchmarking LLM

The following guide provides an example on how to use GenAI-Perf
to measure and characterize the performance behaviors of Large Language Models
(LLMs).

## Setup: Download and configure Triton Server and Client environment

1. In a clean working directory, start by executing the following code snippet
to create a triton model repository:

```bash
MODEL_REPO="${PWD}/models"
MODEL_NAME="gpt2_vllm"

mkdir -p $MODEL_REPO/$MODEL_NAME/1
echo '{
    "model":"gpt2",
    "disable_log_requests": "true",
    "gpu_memory_utilization": 0.5
}' >$MODEL_REPO/$MODEL_NAME/1/model.json

echo 'backend: "vllm"
instance_group [
  {
    count: 1
    kind: KIND_MODEL
  }
]' >$MODEL_REPO/$MODEL_NAME/config.pbtxt
```

2. Download the pre-built Triton Server Container with the vLLM backend from the
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver)
registry.

```bash
export RELEASE=<yy.mm> # e.g. to use the release from the end of April of 2024, do `export RELEASE=24.04`

docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-vllm-python-py3
```

3. Launch the triton container to serve the gpt2_vllm model.

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --net=host --rm --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 \
    --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-vllm-python-py3 \
    tritonserver --model-repository ./models
```

4. In a separate terminal window, download the pre-built Triton SDK Container
which includes GenAI-Perf and Performance Analyzer from the
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver)
registry and launch the container.

```bash
export RELEASE=<yy.mm>
docker run --gpus all -it --net host --shm-size=1g --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk \
  bash
```

5. Profile GPT2 via GenAI-Perf

```bash
genai-perf -m gpt2_vllm --backend vllm --streaming
```

By default, all metrics will saved in the `profile_export_genai_perf.csv` file.
