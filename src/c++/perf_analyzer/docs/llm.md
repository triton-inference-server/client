# Benchmarking LLM

> **Note**
>
> These benchmarks currently only work with Perf Analyzer built from the latest
> `main` branch. See
> [build from source instructions](install.md#build-from-source). If you are using
> Perf Analyzer from the Triton SDK container (e.g.
> `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3-sdk`), you **will need to wait until the
> `23.09` container is released to perform the steps in this guide**.

The following guide shows the reader how to use Triton
[Perf Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer)
to measure and characterize the performance behaviors of Large Language Models
(LLMs) using Triton with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).

### Setup: Download and configure Triton Server environment

From [Step 1 of the Triton vLLM tutorial](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Quick_Deploy/vLLM/README.md#step-1-build-a-triton-container-image-with-vllm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials
cd tutorials/Quick_Deploy/vLLM
docker build -t tritonserver_vllm .
# wait for command to finish, might take several minutes
```

Upon successful build, run the following command to start the Triton Server container:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -p 8001:8001 --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work tritonserver_vllm tritonserver --model-store ./model_repository
# this will run continuously in the current shell
```

Next run the following command to start the Triton SDK container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client.git
cd client/src/c++/perf_analyzer/docs/examples
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --net host -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.09-py3-sdk
```

## Benchmark 1: Profiling the Prefill Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of input prompt
size on first-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute at most one new token. This
essentially means one pass through the model.


#### Run the pre-fill benchmark
Inside the client container, run the following command that generates a dummy prompt of sizes specified by
`--prompt-size-range START END STEP` (`END` inclusive).

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --prompt-size-range 100 900 200 --max-tokens 1

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Prompt size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0421 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0007 sec
#   Prompt size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0312 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0008 sec
#   Prompt size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0289 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0007 sec
#   Prompt size: 700, Average first-token latency: 0.0358 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0007 sec
#   Prompt size: 900, Average first-token latency: 0.0327 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0006 sec
```

> **Note**
>
> In order to provide a specific prompt (instead of the dummy prompt generated by default),
> the user can provide input data JSON file using `--input-data` flag:
> ```bash
> echo '
> {
>     "data": [
>         {
>             "PROMPT": [
>                 "Hello, my name is"  // user-provided prompt
>             ],
>             "STREAM": [
>                 true
>             ],
>             "SAMPLING_PARAMETERS": [
>                 "{ \"max_tokens\": 1 }"
>             ]
>         }
>     ]
> }
> ' > input_data.json
>
> python profile.py -m vllm --input-data input_data.json
> ```
> This will however ignore any parameters specified through the command line.


## Benchmark 2: Profiling the Generation Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of input prompt
size on token-to-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute a fixed amount of tokens.

#### Run the generation benchmark
Inside the client container, run the following command that generates a dummy prompt of sizes specified by
`--prompt-size-range START END STEP` (`END` inclusive).

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --prompt-size-range 100 900 200 --max-tokens 256 --ignore-eos

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Prompt size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0419 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0068 sec
#   Prompt size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0513 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0070 sec
#   Prompt size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0325 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0069 sec
#   Prompt size: 700, Average first-token latency: 0.0325 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0071 sec
#   Prompt size: 900, Average first-token latency: 0.0368 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0071 sec
```
