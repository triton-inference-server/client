# Benchmarking LLM

The following guide shows the reader how to use Triton
[Perf Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer)
to measure and characterize the performance behaviors of Large Language Models
(LLMs) using Triton with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).

### Setup: Download and configure Triton Server environment

From [Step 1 of the Triton vLLM tutorial](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Quick_Deploy/vLLM/README.md#step-1-build-a-triton-container-image-with-vllm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials
cd tutorials/Quick_Deploy/vLLM
docker build -t tritonserver_vllm .
# wait for command to finish, might take several minutes
```

Upon successful build, run the following command to start the Triton Server container:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -p 8001:8001 --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work tritonserver_vllm tritonserver --model-store ./model_repository
```

Next run the following command to start the Triton SDK container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client.git
cd client/src/c++/perf_analyzer/docs/examples
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --net host -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.09-py3-sdk
```

## Benchmark 1: Profiling the Prefill Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of input prompt
size on first-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute at most one new token. This
essentially means one pass through the model.

#### Example

Inside the client container, run the following command to generate dummy prompts
of size 100, 300, and 500 and receive single token from the model for each prompt.

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --prompt-size-range 100 500 200 --max-tokens 1

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Prompt size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0459 sec
#   Prompt size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0415 sec
#   Prompt size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0451 sec
```

> **Note**
>
> In order to provide a specific prompt (instead of the dummy prompt generated by default),
> the user can provide input data JSON file using `--input-data` option.
> This will however *ignore* any parameters specified through the command line.
> ```bash
> $ echo '
> {
>     "data": [
>         {
>             "PROMPT": [
>                 "Hello, my name is"  // user-provided prompt
>             ],
>             "STREAM": [
>                 true
>             ],
>             "SAMPLING_PARAMETERS": [
>                 "{ \"max_tokens\": 1 }"
>             ]
>         }
>     ]
> }
> ' > input_data.json
>
> $ python profile.py -m vllm --input-data input_data.json
> ```


## Benchmark 2: Profiling the Generation Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of input prompt
size on token-to-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute a fixed amount of tokens.

#### Example

Inside the client container, run the following command to generate dummy prompts
of size 100, 300, and 500 and receive total 256 tokens from the model for each prompts.

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --prompt-size-range 100 500 200 --max-tokens 256 --ignore-eos

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Prompt size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0388 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0066 sec
#   Prompt size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0431 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0071 sec
#   Prompt size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0400 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0070 sec
```

## Benchmark 3: Profiling In-Flight Batching

> **Note**
>
> This benchmark relies on the feature that will be available from `23.10` release
> which is on its way soon. You can either wait until the `23.10` container
> is ready or build Perf Analyzer from the latest `main` branch (see [build from source instructions](install.md#build-from-source)).

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of in-flight
batch size on token-to-token latency. We systematically issue requests to the
server of fixed input sizes and request the model to compute a fixed amount of
tokens in order to increase the in-flight batch size over time.

#### Example

In this benchmark, we will run Perf Analyzer in [periodic concurrency mode](inference_load_modes.md#periodic-concurrency-mode)
that periodically launches a new concurrent request to the model using `--periodic-concurrency-range START END STEP` option.
In this example, Perf Analyzer starts with a single request and launches the new ones until the total number reaches 100.
You can also specify the timing of the new requests: Setting the `--request-period` to 32 (as shown below) will make
Perf Analyzer to wait for all the requests to receive 32 responses before it launches the new requests.
Run the following command inside the client container.

```bash
# Install matplotlib to generate the benchmark plot
pip install matplotlib

# Run Perf Analyzer
python profile.py -m vllm --periodic-concurrency-range 1 100 1 --request-period 32 --max-tokens 1024 --ignore-eos

# Sample output
# Saved benchmark result @ 'inflight_batching_benchmark.png'.
```

The resulting plot will look like

<img src="examples/inflight_batching_benchmark.png" width="600">

The plot above shows the change in average token-to-token latency at each request period sized segments across the benchmark.
What this means is that we split the entire benchmark timeline into segments, each with equal size of `--request-period`.
In this example, the first segment will contain 32 responses, the second segment will contain 2*32 responses, and so on:
```
              32 responses (=request period)
                ┌────┐
      request 1 ──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊
      request 2       ┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊
      request 3       ┊      ┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊
      request 4       ┊      ┊      ┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────┊──────
                      ┊      ┊      ┊      ┊      ┊      ┊      ┊
         ...

       segment    1      2      3       4      5      6      7      8      ...
(i-th request period)
```
For each segment (or i-th request period), we compute average token-to-token latency and plot the results.
Since we send total 100 requests, expect 1024 responses back from server, and set request period to 32,
the total number of segments comes out as 131 (see [profile.py](examples/profile.py) for more detail).
