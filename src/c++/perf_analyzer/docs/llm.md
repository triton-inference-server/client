# Benchmarking LLM

The following guide shows the reader how to use Triton
[Perf Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/c%2B%2B/perf_analyzer)
to measure and characterize the performance behaviors of Large Language Models
(LLMs) using Triton with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).

### Setup: Download and configure Triton Server environment

From [Step 1 of the Triton vLLM tutorial](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Quick_Deploy/vLLM/README.md#step-1-build-a-triton-container-image-with-vllm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials
cd tutorials/Quick_Deploy/vLLM
docker build -t tritonserver_vllm .
# wait for command to finish, might take several minutes
```

Upon successful build, run the following command to start the Triton Server container:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -p 8001:8001 --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work tritonserver_vllm tritonserver --model-store ./model_repository
```

Next run the following command to start the Triton SDK container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client.git
cd client/src/c++/perf_analyzer/docs/examples
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --net host -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.09-py3-sdk
```

## Benchmark 1: Profiling the Prefill Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of text input
size on first-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute at most one new token. This
essentially means one pass through the model.

#### Example

Inside the client container, run the following command to generate dummy text inputs
of size 100, 300, and 500 and receive single token from the model for each text input.

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --text-input-size-range 100 500 200 --max-tokens 1

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Text input size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0459 sec
#   Text input size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0415 sec
#   Text input size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0451 sec
```

> **Note**
>
> In order to provide a specific text input (instead of the dummy text input
> generated by default), the user can provide input data JSON file using
> `--input-data` option. This will however *ignore* any parameters specified
> through the command line.
> ```bash
> $ echo '
> {
>     "data": [
>         {
>             "text_input": [
>                 "Hello, my name is"  // user-provided text input
>             ],
>             "stream": [
>                 true
>             ],
>             "sampling_parameters": [
>                 "{ \"max_tokens\": 1 }"
>             ]
>         }
>     ]
> }
> ' > input_data.json
>
> $ python profile.py -m vllm --input-data input_data.json
> ```


## Benchmark 2: Profiling the Generation Phase

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of text input
size on token-to-token latency. We issue single request to the server of fixed
input sizes and request the model to compute a fixed amount of tokens.

#### Example

Inside the client container, run the following command to generate dummy text inputs
of size 100, 300, and 500 and receive total 256 tokens from the model for each text input.

```bash
python profile.py -m vllm --text-input-size-range 100 500 200 --max-tokens 256 --ignore-eos

# Sample output
# [ Benchmark Summary ]
#   Text input size: 100, Average first-token latency: 0.0388 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0066 sec
#   Text input size: 300, Average first-token latency: 0.0431 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0071 sec
#   Text input size: 500, Average first-token latency: 0.0400 sec, Average token-token latency: 0.0070 sec
```

### Benchmark 3: Profiling Continuous Batch Size

In this benchmarking scenario, we want to measure the effect of continuous
batch size on token-to-token latency. We systematically issue requests to the
server of fixed input sizes and request the model to compute a fixed amount of
tokens in order to increase the continuous batching size over time.

#### 1. Generate input data JSON

```bash
# open a new shell in the same directory you were in when running the above command
echo '
{
    "data": [
        {
            "text_input": [
                "Hello, my name is"
            ],
            "stream": [
                true
            ],
            "sampling_parameters": [
                "{\"max_tokens\":16,\"ignore_eos\":true}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
' > text_inputs.json
```

#### 2. Run Perf Analyzer

```bash
perf_analyzer \
    -m vllm \
    -i grpc \
    --async \
    --streaming \
    --input-data=text_inputs.json \
    --profile-export-file=profile_export.json \
    --periodic-concurrency-range=1:20:1
    --request-period=10
```

#### 3. Calculate average token-to-token latency

```bash
python3 examples/calculate_avg_token_to_token_latency.py
# Average token-to-token latency: 0.003090155677419355 s
```

#### 4. Repeat steps 1-3 with different period concurrency range start/end/step and different request period to measure effects of continuous batch size on token-to-token latency (generation).
