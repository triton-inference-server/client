# Recommended Installation Method

## Triton SDK Container

The recommended way to "install" Perf Analyzer is to run the pre-built
executable from within the Triton SDK docker container available on the
[NVIDIA GPU Cloud Catalog](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tritonserver).
As long as the SDK container has its network exposed to the address and port of
the inference server, Perf Analyzer will be able to run.

```bash
export RELEASE=<yy.mm> # e.g. to use the release from the end of February of 2023, do `export RELEASE=23.02`

docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

docker run --gpus all --rm -it --net host nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

# inside container
perf_analyzer -m <model>
```

# Alternative Installation Methods

- [Pip](#pip)
- [Build from Source](#build-from-source)

## Pip

```bash
pip install tritonclient

perf_analyzer -m <model>
```

**Warning**: If any runtime dependencies are missing, Perf Analyzer will produce
errors showing which ones are missing. You will need to manually install them.

## Build from Source

The Triton SDK container is used for building, so some build and runtime
dependencies are already installed.

```bash
export RELEASE=<yy.mm> # e.g. to use the release from the end of February of 2023, do `export RELEASE=23.02`

docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

docker run --gpus all --rm -it --net host nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

# inside container

- To enable
  [CUDA shared memory](input_data.md#shared-memory), add
  `-DTRITON_ENABLE_GPU=ON` to the `cmake` command.
- To enable
  [C API mode](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-triton-directly-via-c-api), add
  `-DTRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_C_API=ON` to the `cmake` command.
- To enable [TorchServe backend](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-torchserve), add
  `-DTRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_TS=ON` to the `cmake` command.
- To enable
  [Tensorflow Serving backend](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-tensorflow-serving),
  add `-DTRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_TFS=ON` to the `cmake` command.
