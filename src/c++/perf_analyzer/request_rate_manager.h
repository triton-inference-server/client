/// An instance of this load manager will be created at the beginning of the

/// requests per second values and to collect per-request statistic.
///
/// Detail:
/// Request Rate Manager will try to follow a pre-computed schedule while
/// issuing requests to the server and maintain a constant request rate. The
/// manager will spawn max_threads many worker thread to meet the timeline
/// imposed by the schedule. The worker threads will record the start time and
/// end time of each request into a shared vector which will be used to report
/// the observed latencies in serving requests. Additionally, they will report a
/// vector of the number of requests missed their schedule.
